### Backbone Zero to Hero
This project is meant to bring new front end developers or those who have been stuck in the back end world
up to speed on some of the core fundamentals of JavaScript and slowly introduce new concepts up until
covering [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org).  

It's not an exhaustive study on JavaScript by any means, but merely a short intro to hopefully bring you up 
to speed as quickly as possible to start building basic Backbone apps.
